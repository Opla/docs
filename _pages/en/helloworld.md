We will first test out the bot with a Hello World statement.

Click on Create,

![image]({{images_path}}first-intent-create.png)

and write "Hello" and enter in the playground just to see that the standard output is "the response".

 click on the pencil to rename "First intent" in the column on the left to "Hello",

Delete "The response" statement by clicking on the minus sign end of line in outputs, then write "Hello World". Click Save in the intents panel.

Here we are, we created our first "Hello World" bot! Pretty straightforward, and as we go we're going to parameter two other schemes of conversation, namely "Pizza", which has us pick yes/no answers, and "Contact", which has us deal with user entries such as contact adress and phone number.
