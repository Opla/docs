and global entities.

## global entities

Global entities must be written in two different panels: in the entities @global panel to be managed,
and in the builder to be exploited.

### In Entities @global

We will insert a list of animals: dog, cat, zebra, dodo.
You are free to complete it by inserting them only with a comma and no space.
(insert dog,cat,zebra,dodo in the Values column)
