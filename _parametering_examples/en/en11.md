# How to ask for e-mail and filter wrong responses :

Entities are programs that recognize in text formatted data. 
With the e-mail entity, we can detect if the information entered is an e-mail, or not, and if not, loop over the question to ask again for a valid e-mail adress. Here is an example of what can be done : 


![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}hello-entities.png)
![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}e-mail-entities.png)
![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}any-entities.png)
