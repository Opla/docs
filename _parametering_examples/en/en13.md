# A simple email sending contact form

We'll build a simple form which sends an e-mail.

![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}hello-simpleform.png)
![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}email-simpleform.png)
![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}any-simpleform.png)


Please note the syntax of the system sendmail : 


### How to describe the syntax

```
system.sendMail(emailRecipient, subject, content)
```

- emailRecipient: The email of the person sending the message
- subject: The subject of the message
- content: The content of the email



In our example, we've got this formulation : 

```
system.sendMail(emilie@opla.ai, `Contact message` , Contact : {$var_name}  {$var_email}    Message : {$message} )
```
This means you can specify the recipient of the e-mail as the first argument in the sendmail, the subject of the e-mail, as ours is "Contact Message", and then all variables defined in the bot along with the {$ } syntax.


in the playground, it shows as such : 

![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}playground-simpleform.png)

and the e-mail received looks as such : 



![image]({{site.images_path | relative_url }}received-simpleform.png)
