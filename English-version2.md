    5. Conditional

When creating a new intent, suppress the "I don't understand" line in Outputs. Then appears a three pointed stars called a conditional. This star is seen as long as outputs do not contain non conditional outputs. Its' code content should be the same as the action code ![image](/assets/images/chevrons.png) in logical order of conversation. <br><br>

**Please note that the interface is not input case sensitive**

When an intent is modified, one must first click the "+" sign on end of line, and then a blue capital SAVE button appears to the right of the Intent's name in Intent screen, on which one must click to save changes.
